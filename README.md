## Project Planning

### Overview

**aMDB**<br>
https://unruffled-curran-775cfe.netlify.app/

**aMDB** is a TV and movie database single page application that allows users to search for a show and see its ratings, reviews, summary, and other details. It also offers lists for what is trending in certain categories and by specific time frames, and a suggestion feature for when you can't decide what to watch.

## Project Delivery

### Code Showcase

This is an event handler function that I had previously written with 4x the amount of code, but Mike helped me refactor it down to the much simpler and more efficient version that's shown here.

```
  const handleChange = (event, newValue) => {
    setValue(newValue);
    const target = event.target.innerText;
    if (lastChecked === '') {
      setChecked({
        ...checked,
        [target]: true
      });
    } else {
      setChecked({
        ...checked,
        [lastChecked]: false,
        [target]: true
      });
    }
    setLastChecked(target);
  };
```

### Code Issues & Resolutions

This project was a tremendous learning experience in using Material UI, setting up dynamic routes, and properly structuring my component hierarchy to take advantage of the routes that I had set up. I didn't stumble across any major issues during development, but I had to read a lot of documentation to learn how to use some of the libraries that I ended up using for transition effects.
